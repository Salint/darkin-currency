# Darkin Currency
A simple and small plugin using the Spigot API for our private Minecraft server.

We use "Darkin coins" as a name. 

This is so simple, and there are better ones out there. I just wanted to learn how to make Spigot plugins.

I might work on it more but I don't have high expectations.
